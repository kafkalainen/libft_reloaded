# libft_reloaded
Libft reloaded,  system functions recreated for a school project at Hive Helsinki.

get_next_line function is also included here, which was a seperate project. In this project we had to create a function that will be able to return next line from a buffer. The trick was that we can only use read and open system functions, so how to read a next line with a static buffer without losing the data already in the buffer?
